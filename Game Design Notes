**Damage Calculation:**
By default, all non-integer damage values will work in favor of the user (round down for ally round up for enemy).

Possibly have two main damage categories:
*Attack Damage, Basic Attack Damage, Attack Power* (Basic Attack Damage)
*Ability Damage, Ability Power, Spell Damage, Spell Power* (The NUMBER that is displayed in the ability description)
Could have it be like hearthstone spell damage, where an ability that says "Deal 1 damage three times" scales differently with *Ability Damage* than "Deal 3 damage"

**Ability Targeting Categories:** (Abilities' should have a categorical system that has some kind of displayed tag on the ability description. EG some category of abilities can have their RANGE buffed by other effects. Could make the destinction between abilities that deal damage vs other effects, this decides the nomanclature for Ability Power vs Ability Damage)
"Cardinal"
"Intercardinal"
"AoE"
"Line Shot"
"Targeted"

**Terrain Types:**

**Grass**: 
**Tall Grass:** Can only be seen by units that are directly adjacent to the current tile.
**Water**: Reduces movement by one tile.
**Mountain**: Cannot be moved through unless the unit has **flying**.
**Forest**: Cannot be moved through unless the unit has **flying**. Can also be destroyed by damage.
**Permafrost**: Units that end their turn on **permafrost** terrain are **chilled** until the end of their next turn.
**Ice**: Units that end their turn on **Ice** terrain are **Chilled** until the end of their next turn. Units that make a directional movement onto **Ice** terrain will slide in the given direction until encountering non-**Ice** terrain. This uses up all remaining movement range for that unit.

Notes:


**Unit Archetypes/Tribes**

**Amalgam**: (Its possible this would be a bad idea but I like the idea of being able to flesh out a comp/multi-tribe comps with a unit like this.)
A 1 cost unit that counts toward all tribes in the game. Other than that it has perfectly average stats and a simple passive/active to not make it worth including over other single-tribe units. 


**Chain Gang**:
**Chained** enemies have their movement range reduced until they leave range. (One issue I have with this mechanic, is that the chain length would need to be pretty long, ideally larger than the movement stat of an average unit (3 tiles).

Line Shot that **chains** target single enemy unit to the caster.

Drags target connected **chained** unit to target tile in range. 

Net ability chains multiple units to the caster

Places a trap that **chains** the next single enemy to the trapped tile.

Passive: Attacking an enemy marks them with a spark for the next three turns.
Active: Sends a bolt of electricity to target spark marked enemy within Y range dealing X damage to that enemy and all units the bolt passed through. If there is another spark marked enemy within Y range the bolt will continue to travel and deal damage to that enemy. The bolt can also be extended over conductive surfaces that enemy is touching (standing in water tiles or *Chains* connected to another unit.

River Binder: (1-Cost) (Not an **Ice Walker**)

**Lumin** (Aesthetically looks very "holy" with beams and walls of bright white light. Maybe in this world light is a resources and manifestation of energy/money.)

"Lightmine Eruptor": (1-Cost)
HP: 8; AD: 2; Range: 3; Movement: 3
Passive: Whenever a **Lumin** effect is triggered, gain 2 AD until the end of your turn.
Ability Tags: Targeted, Delayed
Ability Cooldown: 3
Ability Description: Plant a Lightmine on target *keyword for flat tile aka no mountains (or forests?)* tile. Enemy projectiles that pass over that tile trigger the trap, nullifying their effects and damage. (After being triggered, the effect lingers until end of turn?)

"Lightshield Defender": (2-Cost)
HP: 8; AD: 2; Range: 3; Movement: 3
Passive: **Lumin** effects on tiles adjacent to this unit have their effects increased.
Ability Tags: Targeted, Area
Ability Cooldown: 3

Notes: (Possible infinite combo if the number of enemies hit with the ability is equal to or greater than the ability cooldown. Not saying this is necessarily bad since the positioning is difficult and requires some amount of setup. Aka increasing AoE to 3, decreasing cooldown to 2, some other way to mark enemies.)

"Lumin Protecter": (1-Cost)
HP: 8; AD: 1; Range: 3; Movement: 3
Passive: Whenever a *Lumin* effect is placed on a unit or tile, allies within X range of that unit or tile gain 1 bonus movement (Once per turn per unit).

**Crazy experimental unit**:

Has 10 team cost, basically living out the boss monster fantasy.

**Cloudulon** (thundercloud) unit:

Takes up multiple unit spaces, flying over mountains (and enemy units!?), multiple abilities.

Passive ability: precipitation starts at the beginning of the round, and progresses over the games turns. Stage 1: Rain floods the entire map (Expands rivers? Creates new water? Other effects?) Stage 2: Snow falls “chilling” enemies reducing their movement. Stage 3: Hail cascades from the sky dealing damage to all enemies at the end of each (both players?) turn.

Thunderclap: stuns all enemies within 3 units of the cloud.

Lightning storm: strikes lightning dealing damage to all enemies UNDERNEATH the cloud dealing large amounts of damage.

Wind gust(-actios?): either pulls/pushes all enemies towards/away from Cloudulon or causes a directional gust to swell across the battlefield pushing all units a few tiles in that direction. (Pull/push is more flavorful but might be a little too synergistic with lightning storm, directional gust feels more balanced and trickier to use effectively)


**Elemtentalist/weather “tribe”:**

These units should be relatively low statted, but have large amounts of utility that make them also useful includes in other team compositions. Would be cool to also be able to create a viable team composition by including one of each element (assuming they cost 2), although this team would likely be lacking in damage and consist pretty much entirely of utility units.

Need to figure out how differing weather effects interact with each other. Currently **Rain**, **Snow**, **Hail**, and **Sun** are options. Could do Pokemon style, where whenever a new weather effect comes into play, it overwrites any previous effect. An issue with this method could be that if we create units that are incredibly reliant on their current weather, matching up against an enemy that overwrites it would be a bit coinflippy. 

The main issue with this "elementalist" tribe is that all of their weather effects are passives, so would need to figure out how to handle multiple of these effects triggering at the start of the game, both allied and enemy triggers. 

Wind control stall unit:

Passive: tailwind increases movement of all ally units (within a range?).

Active: low cooldown pushes a gust of wind across the map pushing all enemy units 1 tile in any cardinal direction (global). If unit would run into a mountain or other unit, deal 1 damage to it.

Fog unit:

Passive: Decreases vision of enemy units at the start of the game (either light fog or heavy fog or both by 1 tile)

Active: Low cooldown ability that clears an area anywhere on the map of fog (think blue trinket from LoL) for a turn or two.

Blizzard unit (also part of ice tribe):

Passive: Changes the weather to hail at the start of the game, which deals 1 damage to all units globally at the end of each turn (this is likely much too overpowered, so probably need to change it to either only dealing damage every few turns, or having the damage be dealt or not dealt randomly).

Active: **Freezes** and damages all enemies in a 1-2-3 tile cone in front itself.

Sun (also part of fire tribe):

Passive: Changes the weather to sunny, providing an extra tile of vision (either light fog or heavy fog or both) to all ally units.

Active: **Solar Beam**: Deals damage in a line skillshot passing through enemies but not terrain.

Rain/lightning:

Passive: Changes the weather to rain, spawning additional water tiles across the map.

Active: **Thundercloud**: Causes a stormy cloud to appear over a set of tiles anywhere on the map. The storm lasts a certain amount of turns and causes lightning to strike the area (3x3 aoe) at the end of each turn (ally and enemy turns).


**Top down tribe themes:**

Whirlpools, lava, quicksand?

Spore tribe that implants mind control agents that take hold slowly.

**Sacrifice Faction:**
"Stat Devourer":

Active: "Repair": Low cooldown ability that heals an ally building by a small amount.

Golem Builder Unit (wincon):
Passive: 
Active: 


**"Religious" Faction:**
Revolves around "praying" to a higher power (the player) to smite their enemies. Activating one of these units abilities would increase the "devotion" towards the player and would eventually allow the player to have expanded vision of the map, use special player abilities to damage/effect enemies, and heal allies/buff their stats. Whenever a praying unit dies this reduces the player devotion. Units can increase devotion by praying (simple activation), creating shrines (destructible objects), ritual sacrifice (low range ability execute on a low health unit)

1-Cost Units:
Basic Monk Unit:
Passive: Increases devotion from active ability based on nearby surroundings (shrines, priests, etc).
Active: "Pray": Gives X devotion to player.

Shrine Builder Unit:
Passive: Improves nearby building stats scaling with devotion.

Passive: Slows all enemies by X tiles within Y tiles. Both scale with devotion.
Active: Shoots a damaging beam across two points within Y tile range.

Active: 

Paladin Unit (3-Cost):
Passive: Basic attacks scale in damage with devotion.
Active: Deals damage to an enemy, if that enemy dies gain X devotion.

Player (God) Powers:
Omniscience: Full view of board (no fog)

"Rek'Sai" Unit:
Passive: 
Active: Burrows through the ground to target tile, leaving an entrance/exit tile that can be reused a single time before collapsing the tunnel.
(Tunnel can be reused by ending turn while standing on hole? Might be awkward since presumably the first turn after putting the tunnel down would end on that tile.)

"Yuumi" Unit:
Passive: Can be deployed on the same tile as another allied unit and "equips" on top of it.
Active: 


**Bottom up tribe themes**:

"Going Wide" Synergy Units:
Squad Leader: (2-Cost)

Active: Target enemy within X range becomes marked. Landing three attacks from allies on that enemy (in the same turn?) deals 3 bonus damage.

"Junkbot/Zombie" Token Unit Reborn Mechanic:
Junkbot Manufacturer: (2-Cost)
Passive: Whenever an non-token ally is destroyed, mark that tile with a "scrapile".
Active: Create a "junkbot" token unit in place of target "scrapile", with stats scaled to that "scrapiles" Cost.

"Storm" Mechanic from mtg tribe where unit do more damage scaling with the number of units that used their abilities or attacked before them

**Brush/Tall Grass Synergy Units:**
(Tall Grass is team specific, and only provides the stealth to ally team units. Could start with spawning ally/enemy tall grass on each side of the map?)

Possibly make it so that units in the "shadow realm" can still be attacked somehow. Something in the overworld can be attacked and then when killed it pulls the unit out from the shadow realm. 


Duelist unit:
Passive: gain +1 basic attack range while in shadow realm
Active: transport an enemy unit to the shadow realm for X turns. This unit being destroyed causes this effect to end immediately.

"Inter-dimensional Sacrifice" ability that destroys any number of your own units to summon a unit from your deck with cost equal to the total cost of units sacrificed (-1). Robot Tribal?

"Nearsighted" ability that reduces vision either like Graves Smokescreen or Nocturne ult.

Ability that "Marks an Enemy for Death", that whenever that enemy gets reduced to X health or below, this unit executes it and teleports to tile it was previously on.

**Assassin:** after this unit deals lethal damage to an enemy, this unit may move again/this unit may move a set X tiles.

**Tracking Shot:** Low cool down low damage move that allows the unit to move an additional tile in the direction the projectile was fired if it connects with an enemy.

**Rampage:** After this unit deals lethal damage to an enemy, this unit has its basic attack refreshed and may move an additional X tiles that remain within view of an enemy.

**Exhaust**: Passive mechanic for a tribe, attacking or using abilities "exhausts" all remaining movement (for a possible beneficial effect).


**Large Game Balance Changes/Decisions:**
HEX grid game board??? Inspired by the hexagon youtube video, and I do agree that with the square grid, diagonal based movement and range targeting feels awkward...
Question is do you have the paralell sides of the hexagon face vertically or horizontally along the board. Up/Down edges makes moving directly across the board easier, and also gives more options when moving forward at an angle for a flank. Aesthetic bonus with this orientation is that the front and back of the map are defined by a clean flat edge along both sides.
Downsides: Difficult to move with standard arrow key controls. Could get around this by having left/right (or up/down depending on orientation) arrow keys toggle between the two possible tiles and then requiring a button press to lock in the movement command. Another way to try keyboard controls would be to use "QWEASD", where WS are still up down, and then QE are up left and up right respectively, and AD are down left and down right respectively. Another option is to use arrow keys (or WASD theoretically), and just have left/right rotate the unit and then up/down locks in the movement forward or backwards based on where that unit is facing.

Needs some kind of failsafe to prevent turtling via constantly running away (eg. one flying unit zipping around the map super fast unable to be caught).

To prevent insurmountable kiting and poking in and out of fog of war, possibly restrict movement to only before using attacks and abilities.  Possibly use 3 different color indicators around a unit to display what actions are left. Ie blue aura for movement, yellow for basic attack, red for special attack. By going back to the set move usage of Move → basic attack → ability, the clarity of what the unit is currently capable of would be greatly improved. For some reason mechanically ability usage feels like it would be better to activate before basic attack but that feels like it might be on a case by case basis. Could also allow for Ability/basic attack → Move. Basically not allowing the movement to be split up on each side.
Could even add the effect to move after attacking as a specific bonus. Ie unit/tribe passive, certain abilities that “refresh” movement and/or attacks after killing a unit.


Game feels like it will need an additional incentive or secondary objective to prevent turtling, specifically because of FoW.  Without a specific reason to venture out beyond a player's starting side, the game may feel directionless and slow. 

**Ideas for neutral objectives:** 

"Jungle" camps located near the middle of the map that can be killed for bonus (problem with this idea is that it would be hard to create a reward that doesn't use some kind of gold or XP value that doesn't work with this game, especially if the camps respawn with increasing difficulty).

"Control point" located near the middle of the map to provide some kind of bonus or win condition (this one feels a little too much like a different game mode). 

**Ideas for incentive rewards:** 

Securing a neutral objective could provide either targeted or random vision of enemy or neutral territory (similar to a blue trinket).

Gives the player a certain amount of production points that allows them to either buy or resurrect a unit with that value.

Give both teams full vision of their side of the base at all times?

Reduce ally units cooldowns!

Movement increased for all ally units.

Deploy an additional unit from sideboard equal to X production points.


**Kiting prevention and melee unit sticking power:**
Base idea: Any movement input while next to an enemy costs 1 additional tile.
Additional ideas: Opportunity attacks.

**Overall Unit "Class/Perks" Ideas:**
Maybe seperate units into a set number of defined groups that each get their own unique passive/mechanic? Could even let players customize the perk of the class to choose between options.
Melees "Juggernauts": (Opportunity Attacks/Reduced Enemy Movement) when attempting to move from an adjacent tile.
Midrange: 
Long Range: (When attacking a unit from maximum range, deal bonus damage/This unit may attack twice per turn, with the second attack dealing reduced damage.)

On second thought, its hard to come up with more bonuses for the non-melee classes so maybe it would be best to just simple let the melee perk stand on its own as a buff to all melee units.

**Sideboard:**
Allow for a 5 point sideboard?
Opportunities to swap units around:
Start the game with all 15 points worth of units on the lefthand side during deployment, and then can place up to 10 points worth. (This feels really good!!!)
Could occur after seeing what Faction(s) your opponent has locked in. (Could have a moment pre-deployment where you glean some piece of information about their team, like seeing their highest or lowest cost unit, or maybe the player has to make that decision each match on which unit they want to see ahead of time.)
Could occur after each game of a Best of X match.


**Levels to the stealth that is synced with the fog:**

eg:

Level 1: no stealth

Level 2: light fog/pseudo stealth, a unit it shown to be on the map, but no specific details or which unit it is is shown

Level 3: heavy fog, stealth: unit is not visible to enemies at all

Level 4: true stealth, cannot be visible unless directly next to (melee range) an enemy


Damage Types?: (this is almost definitely a bad idea and would add too much complexity to the game, not to mention coinflippy matchups between teams)

Elemental damage or just physical/magical?

Physical damage (explosions, bullets, melee) can be used to destroy pieces of the environment such as mountains or chests.

Magical? Damage (lasers, spells, ethereal/intangible projectiles)



**Alternative Gamemodes:**
**Team Deathmatch** (default)
Destroy all enemy units to win the match.
**Capture the Flag:**
Place a flag object somewhere in your allied territory and whoever captures the enemies flag first wins the match. Capturing can either be done by immediately winning once you step onto the tile with the enemies flag to win, or you have to deliver it back into allied territory to win.
**Draft:**
Probably hearthstone arena style where you pick one of three options repeatedly.
**Commander:**
Select one of your highest cost units to be your commander, where you win the match by only having to destroy your opponents commander. Possibly make it so that you can only your commander can deal damage to the opponents commander or can only deal the finishing blow to your opponents commander.

**Misc Notes**:
Neutral Enemies that either player can interact with? Passive/Hostile. Small Jungle Basically
Chests to find around the map?
Chest/Neutral Enemy rewards? Reduce CD of abilities, light up enemy territoy. Give the location of all enemies by putting thin fog
Caves that take units to another area of the map??
Have an enemy like the detached hand in the forest in Link to the Past
Units that gain "experience" and level up to unlock attacks and abilities?
Magnet Mechanic like in LoZ Oracle of Seasons?
Two robot factions, two solutions to the ship of Theseus, one about rebuilding robots, one about tearing them down and making new
TF2 crate style for unlocking new units?
Crates are random drops/login bonus? You earn a third of a Key (key fragment) on every win.
If an enemy walks into your vision, that enemy will stay revealed until the end of your next turn?
Full movement and attack control with keyboard, arrows to move, some other button to toggle attack targets
Structures and outposts that can be "crewed" by units. (Crew mechanic like mtg? based on cost instead of power?)
Hexproof? Different versions for can't be targeted by attacks or abilities or both.
Board maps that aren't a square shape, could involve missing blocks/chasms and an island like edge shape.
Use arrow shape to show where units will move.
Moving Ship Maps???
With moving rooms that move/connect every few turns.
Operatable gunships/artilery???
